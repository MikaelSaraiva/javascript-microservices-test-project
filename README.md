# Introduction

This is a project definition to test how a junior developer deals with
Javascript technologies which he may or may not know.

It also tests how the developer uses the git repository.

## Git organization repository

This exercise must be given as a git repository link that the
evaluator can clone.

It is expected that the commit messages are well organized and follow
a pattern. For example, it should not change formats mid-way and each
commit should always do one single thing.

## Documentation

The project should have a minimum documentation on how to set-up, how
to compile, what are its dependencies (which versions if that matters)
and how to run and test it.

## Docker

It is highly desirable that any runtime dependencies can be set-up
with a docker-compose.yml made available by the project itself. That
helps with repeatability and with the learning curve from newer
contributors.

## Project definition

The project consists in creating a REST application with NestJS and a
database backend. There are multiple ways, you should consider which
is best, and why.

The REST application should be able to insert, update and list "dog"
elements which should have the following attributes: race, color and
age.
